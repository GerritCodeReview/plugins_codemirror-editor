      "message": "silly question maybe but we also have the keyboard shortcut \"a\" for opening the reply dialog.\nHow is that keyboard event being intercepted(or is it not), so it should be an issue as well? If typing \"/\" takes focus to the searchbar then typing \"a\" should open the reply dialog?\nIs there something special about \"/\" or do we need to tackle this for all keyboard shortcuts?",

      "message": "yeah but you see the point that if another keyboard shortcut is added for the searchbar then this would need to be updated again as you would need to add another exception for another keyCode.\n\nI would suggest doing what Ben initially suggested which is stop propagation of all keyCodes in general(this prevents this from breaking in the future) and instead add exceptions for which keyboard events you want to allow to propagate. This makes it more resilient to Gerrit changes.",
