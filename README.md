# CodeMirror Editor

A plugin that uses CodeMirror to provide a rich code editing experience in PolyGerrit.

## UI plugin

This plugin is rewritten into Polymer 3 syntax. The `gr-editor.js` is the main entry for the plugin.

But to support the lazy load on the `codemirror` with supported languages, we still have the `codemirror-element.html` as an asset which still built separately as an html.

We may consider drop the selectively language support and in favor of all-in-one bundle in the future or change build rule to support bundle `css` in `js` to move off of the html completely.

## UI tests

To run UI tests here will need install dependencies from both npm and bower.

`npm run wct-test` should take care both for you, read more in `package.json`.

You will need `polymer-bridges` which is a submodule you can clone from: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/repos/polymer-bridges

As polymer 3 no longer support `Polymer.importHref` anymore, Gerrit still supports it through a custom implementation.

## Test plugin on Gerrit

1. Build the bundle locally with: `bazel build :codemirror_editor`
2. Serve your generated 'codemirror_editor.js' somewhere, you can put it under `gerrit/plugins/codemirror-editor/` folder and it will automatically served at `http://localhost:8081/plugins_/codemirror-editor/`
3. Use FE dev helper, https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit-fe-dev-helper/, inject the local served 'codemirror_editor.js' to the page

If your plugin is already enabled, then you can block it and then inject the compiled local verison.
